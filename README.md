Kawaii Cat Gachapon 

Welcome to Kawaii Cat Gachapon, a simple and adorable cat-collecting game inspired by Japanese capsule toy machines! This is a fun, single-file web game built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Spend your coins, turn the crank, and see which cute cat you'll get next!

This project was created as a fun exercise in front-end development, focusing on DOM manipulation, basic game logic, and creating an engaging user experience with a clean, dark-mode aesthetic.

Features

Dark Mode UI: Easy on the eyes with bright, kawaii-inspired accent colors. 
Gachapon Mechanic: Use in-game currency to "purchase" a random cat capsule.
Cat Collection: Your collected cats are saved and displayed in your collection grid. Can you collect them all? 
Passive Currency: Coins are automatically generated over time, so there's always a reason to come back! 
New Cat Modal: A cute pop-up proudly displays the new cat you've received.
Zero Dependencies: Written in pure, vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Single-File Project: The entire game is contained in one .html file, making it incredibly portable and easy to share.

Technologies Used
This project is a demonstration of core web technologies:
HTML5: For the structure and content of the game.
CSS3: For all styling, including:
Flexbox and Grid for responsive layout.
CSS Variables for easy theme management.
Keyframe animations for the capsule dispensing effect.
JavaScript (ES6+): For all the game logic, including:
DOM manipulation to update the game state.
Event Listeners to handle player interaction.
Math.random() for the gachapon's random selection.
setTimeout and setInterval for game timing and animations.

Project Purpose & Learning Goals
This project was built for fun and to practice key front-end development skills. The main goals were:
To create a complete, interactive application from scratch in a single file.
To practice manipulating the DOM based on user actions and game events.
To implement a simple game loop and currency system.
To design an attractive and cohesive user interface using modern CSS.

Future Ideas

This is a simple prototype, but it could be expanded with more features!
[ ] Persistent Storage: Use localStorage to save a player's collection and currency between sessions.
[ ] Cat Rarity: Implement different rarity levels for cats (Common, Rare, Super Rare!).
[ ] Sound Effects: Add cute sounds for button clicks, coin gains, and receiving a new cat.
[ ] More Cats!: Expand the cats array with many more unique cats to collect.
[ ] "Sell" Duplicate Cats: Allow players to sell duplicate cats for more coins.
